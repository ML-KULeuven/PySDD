    """Weighted Model Counting using Stochastic Computing.

    This is an example implementation on how you can create your own Weighted Model Counting
    algorithm on top of the PySDD library.

    This class is a demonstration how stochastic computing [1,2] could be used for weighted model counting
    given an SDD datastructure. The basic concept is that instead of propagating floating point numbers
    through the SDD, only True and False samples are passed through. Each leaf generates samples from
    a Bernouilli distribution with as parameter the probability associated, the samples collected at the
    root node then represent a Bernouilli distribution with as mean the Weighted Model Count.

    The main change is that a conjunction or multiplication is replaced with an AND gate and a
    disjunction or addition is replaced with a MUX gate. Since a MUX gate rescales the result of
    the addition back to the range [0,1], we need to keep track of scaling factors to tune the MUX
    gates in the network.

    While Stochastic Computing has some advantages, like small circuit surface, cheap hardware, and
    robust against noise, it also has some significant disadvantages. For high precision computation
    it needs an exponential large number of bits (2^n for an n-bit binary number) and the random
    number generator is expensive.
